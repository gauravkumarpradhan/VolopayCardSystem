Points which i have achieved in the project which was told to implement:

<ul>
  <li>When a user clicks on your tab they should see cards belonging to them through owner_id.</li> 
<li> Create a page with [Your, all, blocked] cards tabs.</li>
<li>Cards can be of two types ['burner', "subscription"]</li>
<li>for burner cards show expiry in card design</li>
<li>for subscription card show limit as shown</li>
<li>A card type is displayed on the top right corner of each card, you can refer to the image for the icon.</li>
<li>Since API response will be paginated you need to implement infinite scroll to fetch more data, you can fetch 10 records per call.</li>
<li>Implement search by card name.</li>
<li>Filter by card type is mandatory. Refer to the figure below.</li>
</ul>
