# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To clone a the project from GitHub and run it locally, you can follow these steps:

Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project: Use the cd command to change directories. For example, if you want to clone the project into your "Documents" folder, you can run:

### `cd Documents`

Go to the GitHub page of the React project you want to clone. Copy the repository's URL (e.g., https://github.com/username/projectname.git). In your terminal, run the following command:
### `git clone https://github.com/gauravkumarpradhan/VolopayCardSystem.git`

Enter the cloned project directory: After the cloning process completes, use the cd command to enter the project directory:
### `cd projectname`


Install project dependencies: React projects typically use npm (Node Package Manager) to manage dependencies. Run the following command to install the necessary packages:
###`npm install`

Start the development server: Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server using the following command:
### `npm start`
