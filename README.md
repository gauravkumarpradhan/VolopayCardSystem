#Points which i have achieved in the project which was told to implement:

1> When a user clicks on your tab they should see cards belonging to them through owner_id.
2> Create a page with [Your, all, blocked] cards tabs.
3> Cards can be of two types ['burner', "subscription"]
4> for burner cards show expiry in card design
5> for subscription card show limit as shown
6> A card type is displayed on the top right corner of each card, you can refer to the image for the icon.
7> Since API response will be paginated you need to implement infinite scroll to fetch more data, you can fetch 10 records per call.
8> Implement search by card name.
9> Filter by card type is mandatory. Refer to the figure below.
